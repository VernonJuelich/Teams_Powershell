# PowerShell Script for Managing Microsoft Teams Voice Public Holiday Schedules

## AU Teams Holiday Mangement.ps1
This PowerShell script streamlines the management of Public Holiday schedules within your Microsoft Teams Voice environment. It fetches the latest public holiday data for specified Australian states from data.gov.au and provides options to either create new holiday schedules or update existing ones.
### Features
1. **Australian State Selection**
   - Prompts you to enter the Australian state codes (e.g., sa, qld, nsw) for which you want to manage public holidays.
2. **Data Source Integration**
   - Retrieves up-to-date public holiday information directly from data.gov.au.
3. **New Schedule Creation**
   - Allows you to create new Teams Voice holiday schedules based on the fetched data.
   - Offers the flexibility to apply the same action to all imported holidays or configure actions individually.
4. **Existing Schedule Updates**
   - Identifies and updates existing Teams Voice holiday schedules with the latest dates.
   - Updates are intelligently applied only to holidays falling within the current or the following year.
   - Attempts to match holidays based on specific naming conventions or broader state-level groupings.
### Prerequisites
- **Microsoft Teams PowerShell Module:** Ensure it's installed (`Install-Module MicrosoftTeams`).
- **Internet Connectivity:** The script needs to access data.gov.au.
- **Teams Voice Permissions:** You'll need sufficient permissions to manage call flow schedules in Microsoft Teams.
### Assumptions
- **Initial Schedule Creation:** This script assumes that if you're using the 'update' mode, the initial holiday schedules were likely created using a similar naming convention (e.g., "NSW Boxing Day" or "NSW Public Holiday").
### Notes
- **Skipping Specific Holidays:** To exclude specific holidays during the import, you can modify the `Get-PublicHolidays` function around line 83 to filter by the 'Holiday Name'.
